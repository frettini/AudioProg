# AudioProg

This repo contains the code for the laboratory of the Audio Programming class of the Electronics with Music course (University of Glasgow).

Throughout those labs we create audio programming objects such as oscillators and filters to learn about object oriented and audio programming.

The code uses python and python packages such as numpy and matplotlib.
